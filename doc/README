The region extension redirects a user to a siteaccess based on his ip address.
This can be done in the background (the ip address is checked in the database)
automatically, or the user can choose a country siteaccess in a specific
pagelayout.

Features
--------
 * Multi-country regions
 * Region alert (when the region detected differs from the current region)

This extension includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from
http://maxmind.com/

The geo ip database is taken from
http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoIPCountryCSV.zip

When geo-detection is triggered
====================================
Geo-detection is triggered when a user requests the home page or a non-region-specific URL (e.g /verve).


How the geo-detection works
===========================

In order to serve up a siteaccess, the region extension must formulate a region via a country code and a language.

1. Country code
	- GET variable 'TESTIP' (IP address) or 'country' (2-char country code)
	- it will first try to find a preferred region by looking up the user's IP address in a MaxMind Geo-lite database
   (sucked into MySQL DB tables)
   
2. Language
   - GET variable 'lang' (containing 3-char language code)
   - Browser languages

   
It formulates the region in the following order:

1. Exact match of region (language + country code) in list of available regions ("LanguageSA" under "RegionalSettings" in site.ini)
2. First item in above list with a country match
3. First item in above list with a language match
4. First item in above list

Setup
===============================================================================
- install extension
- run php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php
- activate the extension in your site.ini.append
- edit settings/region.ini
- clear ini cache

Template operators
==================

{in_region('my-region')} 
- Works with the RegionCountryList setting in region.ini, under [Regions].  
- returns true if the user's country is listed in the specified RegionCountryList e.g RegionCountryList[my-region]
- otherwise returns false
- works with 'TESTIP' and 'country' GET variables listed above, for testing purposes  

Region alert
============
This feature pops up a jQueryUI dialog when the region a user is visiting does not match their geo-detected region.  They are offered the choice of continuing to the selected region or going to their geo-detected region.

To install:
1. Uncomment jquery and jqueryUI in settings/design.ini.append.php or ensure these are available on the pages you want to apply this to.
2. Add {include uri="design:region_alert.tpl"} to your footer tpl or on the pages you want to apply it to.
3. Add the following to settings/override/site.ini.append.php:

 [RoleSettings]
 PolicyOmitList[]=region/check

?>
